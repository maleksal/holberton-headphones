# Implement a design from scratch

In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page.  You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously. 

You wonâ€™t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional  web page that looks the same as the designer file.



# Requirements

- you are not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap)
- you are not to use JavaScript
